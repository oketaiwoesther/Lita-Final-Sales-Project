### Project Title: Sales Analysis
### Project Overview
This data analysis project focuses on uncovering insights from last year's sales performance. Through careful analysis of key data metrics, we aim to gain valuable information that drives strategic decision-making. By identifying patterns and top-performing areas, weâ€™ll create a clear narrative around the data, turning insights into actionable stories for enhanced understanding and results.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset for this analysis, Data_sales.csv, is an open-source file exclusively available for download to members of the Ladies in Tech Africa group. It can be accessed through various online platforms and open data repositories.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  for Data Cleaning Analysis and Visualization [Download Here](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/10186984/files/folder/Capstone%20Project)
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Power BI - For Visualization
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Project Objective
This project was designed to address the following Analysis goals;

1. Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month
2. Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
3. Create any other interesting report
4. Retrieve the total sales for each product category.
5. Find the number of sales transactions in each region.
6. Find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
7. Calculate total revenue per product.
8. Calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
9. Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
10. Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
11. Identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
12. Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.
   












### Data Cleaning and Preparation
At the beginning of data cleaning and preparation, we carry out the following steps:
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and formatting

###Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves examining the data to address various questions, such as:
What is overall Sales trend
Which product are top sellers
what are the Products on peak sales?

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

```SQL 
SELECT * FROM TABLE 1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
